An automated system in Salesforce that calculates costs based on discounts, number of subjects enrolled and scholarships, and then it automatically sends this quote to the respective student in a PDF file.

Hi, If you are about to see my work, I have not finished yet, I am currently working on finishing the tests which is taking me more than expected, for the while, all my code for triggers, classes and visualforce page is done. Also, I've added some screenshots to technical_documentation > Images, where I show the pdf with the tuition invoice that was sent to my email, also I made it so the pdf file would automatically be saved into Salesforce in the "Quote pdf".
