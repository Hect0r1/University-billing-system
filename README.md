Hi, If you are about to see my work, I have not finished yet, I am currently working on finishing the tests which is taking me more than expected, for the while, all my code for triggers and classes is done. Also, I've added some screenshots to technical_documentation > Images, where I show the pdf with the tuition invoice that was sent to my email, also I made it so the pdf file would automatically save into Salesforce in the "Quote pdf".
